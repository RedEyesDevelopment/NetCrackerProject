                    <p>
                        The cultural landmarks of New York City — and the iconic beauty of Central Park — just steps away. It’s all the vibrancy of Manhattan with the quiet comforts of a stately, tree-lined neighborhood. NC Hotel is accessible to Manhattan’s downtown destinations and uptown landmarks. Feel like staying in? Rooms are available — some with balconies overlooking the NYC skyline and the Hudson River, and all with modern comforts. Plus, we have two acclaimed restaurants and a bar right in the hotel. Options abound.
